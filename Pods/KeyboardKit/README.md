## About KeyboardKit

`KeyboardKit` is a helps you create custom keyboard extensions for `iOS` and `ipadOS`. It provides you with a rich set of keyboard-specific tools and actions, haptic and audio feedback support and lets you create keyboards with characters, emojis, images, custom actions etc.

If you're new to iOS keyboard extensions, [this great guide][Guide] can help you get started. You can also have a look at the demo apps for examples on how to use this library. 


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/KeyboardKit.git
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'KeyboardKit'
end

target 'MyKeyboard' do
  pod 'KeyboardKit'
end
```


## Getting Started

After importing `KeyboardKit`, make your extension inherit `KeyboardInputViewController` instead of `UIInputViewController`. It provides you with many tools that helps you build custom keyboard extension.

KeyboardKit supports both `UIKit` and `SwiftUI`, so you can pick the option that suits your needs best. 


## UIKit

[Read more here][UIKit] about creating keyboard extensions with `UIKit`.

`SwiftUI` is the main focus going forward, but UIKit support will still be around and improved if needed.


## SwiftUI

[Read more here][SwiftUI] about creating keyboard extensions with `SwiftUI`.

Due to a [Swift toolchain bug][Bug], SwiftUI support must be kept in a separate library called [KeyboardKitSwiftUI][KeyboardKitSwiftUI]. 

Until the bug is fixed, you must add both `KeyboardKit` and `KeyboardKitSwiftUI` to your project if you want to use `SwiftUI` to create keyboard extensions.


## Actions

KeyboardKit supports many different keyboard actions, like `character` inputs, `emoji` inputs, `backspace`, `newline`, `space`, `image` etc. You can even create your own, custom actions.

[Read more here][Actions]


## Keyboard Types

KeyboardKit supports many different keyboard types, like `alphabetic`, `numeric`, `symbolic`, `emoji` etc. You can even create your own, custom keyboard types.

[Read more here][Keyboard-Types]


## Autocomplete

KeyboardKit supports autocomplete and can present autocomplete suggestions to users as they type. 

[Read more here][Autocomplete]


## Haptic Feedback

KeyboardKit supports haptic feedback and can give users haptic feedback as they type. 

[Read more here][Haptic-Feedback].


## Audio Feedback

KeyboardKit supports audio feedback and can give users audio feedback as they type. 

[Read more here][Audio-Feedback].


## Extensions

KeyboardKit comes with many keyboard-specific extensions. Check out the demo apps and source code for examples and more information.


## Demo Applications

This repository contains two demo apps that demonstrate different keyboard types, like `alphabetical` (lower/uppercased and caps locked), `numerical`, `symbols`, `emojis` and `images`.

* `KeyboardKitDemoKeyboard` uses `UIKit` to implement various keyboards that mimics system keyboards. 
* `KeyboardKitDemoKeyboard_SwiftUI` uses `SwiftUI` to implement various keyboards that mimics system keyboards.

Since [KeyboardKitSwiftUI][KeyboardKitSwiftUI] is still under development, the `SwiftUI` demo app lacks a lot of functionality that the `UIKit` app has.

To run the demo app, open and run the `KeyboardKit.xcodeproj` project then enable the keyboards under system settings. Don't forget to enable full access.

`IMPORTANT` Audio feedback, haptic feedback and image actions require full access.
