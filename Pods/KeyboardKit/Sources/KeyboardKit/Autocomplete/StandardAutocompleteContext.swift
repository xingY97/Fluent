 This class lets you store autocomplete suggestions. It will
 call the provided `suggestionsDidChange` block whenever the
 suggestion collection changes.
 
 If you target iOS 13 and later, `KeyboardKitSwiftUI` can be
 used instead. It contains an `ObservableAutocompleteContext`
 that has better value binding capabilities.
