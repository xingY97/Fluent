/**
 This collection view displays a single cell for each action.
 You can customize it and its appearance in any way you want,
 e.g. by setting a custom flow layout.
 
 This view can be created with a set of actions and a button
 creator, which creates a button for each action and adds it
 to the dequeued cell.
 
 Note that the class aims at simplifying creating collection
 based keyboards, but does so with a performance cost. It is
 less performant than `KeyboardCollectionView` since it only
 reuses the cells, but recreates the buttons every time.
