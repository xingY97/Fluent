    /**
     Map a list of image names to a list of `.image` actions,
     using certain image name matching prefixes and suffixes.
     
     The `keyboardImageNamePrefix` and `Suffix` are used for
     mapping each `imageName` to a `keyboardImageName`. This
     name can be different from the image name. For instance,
     if you provide an `emoji-` prefix but let the suffix be
     empty, an action that has the `imageName` set to `heart`
     will have `emoji-heart` as `keyboardImageName`.
     
     The `localizationKey` prefix and suffix are used to map
     each `imageName` to a localization key, which will then
     be used to get translated `description`s for each image,
     which for instance can be used for accessibility labels.
     
     `throwAssertionFailure` will cause your app to crash in
     development, whenever a translated description can't be
     generated for an image. It is `true` by default.
