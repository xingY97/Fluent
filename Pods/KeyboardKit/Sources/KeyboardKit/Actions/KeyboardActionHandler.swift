 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 keyboard actions.
 
 The `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` class provides standard
 action handling by using the provided action's own standard
 action for a provided gesture. `KeyboardInputViewController`
 uses a standard handler as `keyboardActionHandler`, but you
 can replace it with a custom action handler.
