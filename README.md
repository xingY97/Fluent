# learning_on_the_go

**Learning on the go** is an iphone keyboard app where whenever a user uses their keyboard to text a friendm it automatically shows a translation of what they've typed in the language they are learning. For example, if someone texts their friend "How are you?" then the Spanish equivalent phrase would appear above the keyboard. "como estas?"
