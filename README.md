 # **What is Fluent** 
 Fluent is an iphone keyboard app where whenever a user uses their keyboard to text a friendm it automatically shows a translation of what they've typed in the language they are learning. For example, if someone texts their friend "How are you?" then the Spanish equivalent phrase would appear above the keyboard. "como estas?"


**Make sure change the xcode running scheme to the extension before running on a simulator**
